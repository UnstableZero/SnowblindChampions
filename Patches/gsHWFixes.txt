Notes on gsHWfixes: 
    The following is my current config inside GameIndex.yaml.
    SLUS-20565:
  name: "Champions of Norrath"
  region: "NTSC-U"
  compat: 5
  gameFixes:
    - BlitInternalFPSHack # Fixes internal fps detection in some areas.
  gsHWFixes:
    estimateTextureRegion: 1 # Improves performance.
    roundSprite: 1 # Fixes lines in menus HUD and in game.
    halfPixelOffset: 2 # Fixes erroneous line in menus.
    disablePartialInvalidation: 1 # Improves performance.

    The PAL copies of the game use these, and an extra PCRTCOverscan that I cannot perceive a meaningful difference in.
    Performance improvements are noticeable in Ant Hill 1, Lava Fields 1/2, and Caves of Khathuun (very meaningul).
    Improvements seem to be so significant that using FrustumFix seems non-problematic, need lower-end testing.
